            <p>By completing this questionnaire, I affirm the answers I have provided above are accurate.  In addition, I agree to follow required safety precautions mandated by CoxHealth.  At a minimum, those include wearing a mask that covers my nose and mouth at all times while on any CoxHealth campus, unless I am alone in a private office safely distanced from others.  I also understand that I may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, if I fail to follow the safety precautions mandated by CoxHealth.</p>
